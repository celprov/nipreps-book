In this lesson, we'll demonstrate how to make a new contribution to *dMRIPrep* by walking through the implementation of a head-motion correction algorithm. In the process, you'll also be introduced to several tools in the NiPreps arsenal, including NiBabel, NiTransforms, NiPype and NiWorkflows.

Subject motion within the scanner is a major source of dMRI artifacts!

A common way of correcting for head-motion and eddy-current distortions is to co-register each diffusion-weighted image to a reference unweighted b0 image.
Subsequently, the gradient encoding directions at each image need to be re-oriented to account for this motion.

## Motivation

- open source solution
- unified API for performing head-motion correction on shelled and Cartesian or random q-space sampling schemes
- separate sdc from head motion correction (allow QCing steps separately) - using sdcflows
- provide motion parameters or other confounds in easy to parse tsv

`eddy_correct` trilinear interpolation
take first volume as reference b0
split all volumes into separate files

`flirt` to register each volume to the first
`fslmerge -t` to merge them all together

cannot handle multi-shell or high B0 values and cannot correct for high motion participants

FSL eddy models diffusion signal using Gaussian processes instead of parametric models like DTI and DKI
how to explain the difference in approaches?

**Problem**: although most dMRI practitioners employ FSL for the estimation and correction of head-motion and eddy-current distortions, the FSL toolbox has restrictions of commercial use. By using FSL's eddy implementation, *dMRIPrep* inherits those restrictions.
Therefore, a fully-open implementation of *dMRIPrep* would require eliminating FSL as a dependency.
In this case, we will provide our own implementation of an algorithm for head-motion and eddy-current-derived distortions.

**The proposed solution**: we will design a model-based algorithm for the realignment of dMRI data.
This is based on an idea first proposed by [Ben-Amitay et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22183784/) and implemented as the SHORELine algorithm in [qsiprep](https://github.com/mattcieslak/ohbm_shoreline/blob/master/cieslakOHBM2019.pdf).
